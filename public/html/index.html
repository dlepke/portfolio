    <h3>Hello, world!</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Deanna, and I am a recent graduate from

    <!-- <p>
      I made this website to showcase some of the work I've done. It's an
      assortment of homework assignments, personal projects, and exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a section of the site built using Django - this is to run things
      like my machine learning models, and some of my Python assignments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest is built using JavaScript - the Pokemon section is a React app,
      and the rest is vanilla JS.
